# Power BI Healthcare Dashboard

## Project Overview

This **Healthcare Dashboard** is developed in Power BI to provide a comprehensive, data-driven overview of various healthcare metrics within a hospital or healthcare facility. It aims to support administrators, healthcare providers, and decision-makers by delivering insights into the operational, financial, and clinical aspects of healthcare delivery. The dashboard integrates data from various sources and presents it in an intuitive, interactive format, focusing on key healthcare metrics such as patient demographics, billing information, bed occupancy, doctor feedback, billing versus insurance statistics, and diagnosis trends.

### Purpose

The goal of this dashboard is to enable healthcare organizations to:
- **Monitor patient information** efficiently.
- **Track financial performance** including billing versus insurance claims.
- **Analyze healthcare operations**, such as bed occupancy and staff utilization.
- **Assess healthcare quality** through feedback on doctors and diagnosis statistics.

This interactive dashboard is designed to improve operational decision-making, resource allocation, and quality of care while providing a transparent view into the hospital's financial health.

## Features

The dashboard encompasses several key features that help healthcare administrators analyze various aspects of hospital performance:

### 1. **Patient Information Dashboard (by Patient ID)**

- **Patient Demographics**: Displays essential information such as patient ID, gender, age, and medical history.
- **Admission and Discharge Data**: Insights into patient admission dates, discharge dates, and length of stay (LOS).
- **Status Tracking**: Tracks the current status of patients (e.g., in-patient, out-patient, discharged).
- **Treatment & Procedures**: Provides a summary of major treatments, surgeries, and medical procedures performed on patients, linked to relevant costs and recovery details.
  
**Insights Provided**:
- Demographic distribution of patients.
- Key trends in patient admissions.
- Length of stay (LOS) statistics for different diagnoses or treatment categories.

### 2. **Billing Information Dashboard**

- **Total Billing Overview**: Displays the total amount billed across various patient services (e.g., room charges, diagnostics, surgeries).
- **Payment Status**: Breakdown of payments by status (Paid, Pending, Overdue).
- **Departmental Billing Breakdown**: A detailed analysis of how different departments (e.g., Cardiology, Neurology, Surgery) contribute to overall billing.
- **Revenue by Service**: Displays the revenue generated by specific medical procedures, doctor consultations, or hospital services.

**Insights Provided**:
- Financial health of the hospital from billing.
- Identification of departments or services with higher revenue potential.
- Billing efficiency, including the time between invoicing and payment.

### 3. **Bed Occupancy Breakdown**

- **Bed Usage Statistics**: Tracks the total number of beds available versus occupied.
- **Occupancy by Department**: Displays occupancy rates by department (e.g., ICU, Emergency, General Wards).
- **Historical Bed Occupancy Trends**: Provides historical data on bed occupancy to help predict peak periods and manage resources effectively.
- **Room Type Utilization**: A detailed breakdown of occupancy by room type (e.g., private, semi-private, shared rooms).

**Insights Provided**:
- Peak occupancy periods and trends.
- Department-level occupancy rates.
- Resource allocation strategies to manage patient load effectively.

### 4. **Doctor Feedback Dashboard**

- **Patient Ratings**: Aggregated patient feedback on doctor performance based on surveys or rating systems.
- **Performance Metrics**: Average ratings on key performance indicators such as communication, professionalism, and treatment effectiveness.
- **Time-based Feedback Trends**: Analysis of patient feedback over time, identifying any improvement or decline in doctor performance.
- **Doctor Comparison**: Allows comparison of feedback between different doctors or departments to identify top performers and areas of improvement.

**Insights Provided**:
- Key areas for improvement in doctor-patient interactions.
- Real-time performance feedback on doctors.
- Correlation between doctor feedback and patient outcomes.

---

### 5. **Billing vs. Insurance Dashboard**

- **Billed Amount vs. Paid Claims**: Compares the total billed amount with the claims approved by insurance companies.
- **Insurance Claim Approval Rates**: Displays trends in insurance claim approvals, denials, and pending claims.
- **Out-of-Pocket Costs**: Analyzes the costs that patients need to pay out of pocket versus those covered by insurance.
- **Insurance Company Breakdown**: Breaks down billing data by insurance provider, showing how each insurer processes claims.

**Insights Provided**:
- Key trends in the approval/denial of insurance claims.
- Financial gaps between billing and insurance coverage.
- Identification of delays or issues in the insurance claim process.

---

### 6. **Diagnosis Statistics Dashboard**

- **Top Diagnoses**: Displays the most common diagnoses across various specialties.
- **Diagnosis Frequency**: Presents the frequency of specific diagnoses over time and in different demographics (age, gender, etc.).
- **Diagnosis Trends by Department**: Provides insights into which diagnoses are more prevalent in particular departments (e.g., orthopedics, cardiology).
- **Diagnosis Demographics**: Breaks down the frequency of diagnoses by demographic information, highlighting any patterns in specific groups.

**Insights Provided**:
- Identification of the most common conditions being treated.
- Resource allocation based on the most frequent diagnoses.
- Trends in diagnosis across different patient demographics.

---

## Data Sources

The data is sourced from multiple integrated systems within the healthcare organization:

- **Electronic Health Records (EHR)**: For patient demographics, admissions, and medical history.
- **Billing System**: For data related to services billed, payment status, and insurance claims.
- **Room Management System**: For bed occupancy and department-level resource allocation data.
- **Doctor Feedback Surveys**: Aggregated from patient surveys and feedback forms.
- **Insurance Claim Data**: Sourced from insurance companies and the claims management system.
- **Diagnosis Database**: Pulled from the hospital's clinical systems, categorizing patient diagnoses.

## How to Use the Dashboard

### 1. **Opening the Power BI File**
   - Download the Power BI file (.PBIX) from the repository.
   - Open the file using [Microsoft Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/).
   - Ensure that the appropriate connections to the data sources are set up (e.g., SQL Server, Excel files).

### 2. **Interacting with the Dashboard**
   - **Filters**: Use filters to drill down into specific time periods, departments, or patient demographics.
   - **Visualizations**: Hover over charts and graphs to view detailed tooltips with exact values.
   - **Exporting Data**: Power BI allows you to export visualizations and underlying data into Excel or CSV formats for further analysis.

### 3. **Refreshing Data**
   - Ensure the data sources are connected to real-time or regularly updated systems to keep the dashboardâ€™s insights up-to-date.
   - Click on **"Refresh"** to pull the latest data.
